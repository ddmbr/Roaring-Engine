--------------------------------------------

This is a online car racing game based on Pygame and the Serge engine.

. The project is still not finished, however playable
. A video demo is available, though rough, since time is limited (:
. **NEED** python-rsvg, pymunk, python-cairo libraries.
. Online playing is already implemented but buggy, as UDP connection is not stable.
. Use ASDW and SPACE to control the car.
